# configuration variables: configuration variables can be available for all workflows in our repository and for multiple repositories in our organization
# we will define the configurstion variables in organization level or repository level or environment level 
# we can define configuration variables and secrets inside the environment
# secrets are encripted variables are not encripted. we use secrets to store sensitive information
# we can also set secrets and variables in the repository level and organization level path--in repository>>setings>>secrets and variables>>actions>> where you can define environment, repository and organizational level vars and secrets
# if we don't specify environment in our workflow then we cannot see environment variable in our logs
